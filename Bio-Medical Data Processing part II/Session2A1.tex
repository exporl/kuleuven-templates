\section{Appendix for question 1}

Signals are uncorrelated if their covariance is zero:

\begin{equation}\label{equati1}
E(y_{1}y_{2})-E(y_{1})E(y_{2})=0
\end{equation}

Signals are independent iff their joined probability is equal the production of the respective probability:

\begin{equation}\label{equati2}
p(y_{1}y_{2})=p(y_{1})p(y_{2})
\end{equation}


Independece implies uncorrelatndess whereas the other way around is not true.
